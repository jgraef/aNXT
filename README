libnxt - A C library for using LEGO Mindstorms NXT

COMPILING A PROGRAM WITH LIBNXT:
	Example:
	gcc -o foobar `nxt-config --cflags --libs`

USE FOR TESTING:
        You will find some compiled programs in the bin directory after
        compilation. They can be used easily to test the most important 
        commands of libnxt from the shell command prompt.

HELP:
	Take a look in the directory "examples/" if you want to get a 
        small overview on how to use libnxt.
	If you are having problems send me a mail: janosch.graef@gmx.net

USB-PERMISSIONS:
	By default the NXT is only writeable by root. Run 'make udev' to add 
        udev-rules (40-nxt.rules) to make the NXT writable for group 'users'

BLUETOOTH SECURITY:
	You need a tool for handling bluetooth security. There are several 
        out there and it won't be hard to find one.
