aNXT -	a NXt Toolkit 0.10
	Libraries and tools for LEGO Mindstorms NXT robots

COMPILING A PROGRAM WITH THE aNXT LIBRARY:
	Example:
	gcc -o foobar foobar.c `anxt-config --cflags --libs` 

USE FOR TESTING:
        You will find some compiled programs in the bin directory after
        compilation. They can be used easily to test the most important 
        commands of aNXT from the shell command prompt.

HELP:
	Take a look in the directory "examples/" (or "examples/c") if you 
        want to get a small overview on how to use aNXT.
	If you are having problems send me a mail: janosch.graef@gmx.net

USB-PERMISSIONS:
	By default the NXT brick is only accessable by root. 
        Run 'nxt_udev' to add udev-rules (40-nxt.rules) to make the 
        NXT accessable for group 'users'

BLUETOOTH SECURITY:
	You need a tool for handling bluetooth security. There are several 
        out there and it won't be hard to find one.
