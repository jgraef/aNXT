~~~~~~~~~~CODING GUIDELINES~~~~~~~~~~

Function naming:
	Function names are build up in the following way:
	nxt[_GROUP]_PREDICATE[_OBJECT]
	Examples:
	nxt_sensor_get_value(), nxt_open, nxt_psp_get_joystick()
	"sensor" and "psp" are the group names, the "get"s are predicates and
	"value" and "joystick" are objects. All group names are defined below.

	Frequently used predicates:
		get
		set
		num: short for "(to) number"
		send
		recv: short for "(to) receive"
		cmd: short for "(to) command"
		reset
	As you can see, frequently used predicates used to get shortened.

	Group names:
		(sys): TODO Do we need a sys group?
		err: short for "error"
		file
		sensor
		motor
		tacho
		msg: short for "message"
		snd: short for "sound"
		ls: short for "lowspeed"
		i2c
		mod
		display
		accel: short for acceleration
		hid
		cam
		psp
		us

	Remember that those are just guidelines and nobody is forced to obey
	them. But nevertheless those guidelines should help to get aNXT code
	structured.
