When involved via bluetooth, the NXT brick has to be switched on and off before
the next command via bluetooth can be used. Otherwise, you get a 
"Could not find NXT" error.

You can not get automatically access to the NXT brick.

Either you need access rights to the NXT usb device. Use root rights or see  
.I nxt_udev(8) 
for more information.

Or you need to pair the bluetooth devices of the host computer and the 
NXT brick. There are several programs to do this, one is 
"kbluetoothd".
